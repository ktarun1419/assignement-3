# Fragmentation
## coin data
firstly i have made a hook to retrive coin data because that data will be used many times so it will be quick and will save a lot of time to create a hook and use it
## useSendTransaction
in this i have created a hook that will take parameters like tokenaddress, abi, method , arguments and signer and it will return the function sendTrnasaction , variables like isPending, isApproved which can be used for further UI enhancements and it can be reused for many transactions 
## Components 
rest i have also changed the UI into further components to stable divide the code into fragments
## FYI
there may be errors because for testing there was no time and i can assure you i can create better than this with woring model
